## Plotting publicly available COVID data for the state of Ohio. 

Most recent data: Dec 14 2023. 

#### Data source
These plots are made using the summary data posted by the state of Ohio for the new case rate,
    new hospitalization, and new death plots. The three most recent dates are omitted, as the data is very incomplete. Values for the most recent two weeks may change, and are flagged by a paler tone color in the plots below. 

Ohio has transitioned to updating its dashboards once a week, on Thursdays. Data can only be posted on Thursdays as a result. 

*The Ohio Department of Health is no longer updating testing data, as of April 4th, 2022. Testing and testing positivity plots can no longer be updated.*
