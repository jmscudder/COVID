## Plotting publicly available COVID data for the state of Ohio. 

Last updated: Mar 28 2021. 

As of March 02, death data is only reported 2x/week, and includes only confirmed cases. March 02 cumulative death counts have dropped due to the missing "probable" cases.

Feb 11th-28th involved a "reconciling" of death data for November & December.

Dec 8th completed a backlog of reporting of antigen test results, dating back to Nov 1st.

No data was reported on Nov 26th (Thanksgiving), Dec 25th (Christmas), or Jan 1st (New Year's).
