## Plotting publicly available COVID data for the state of Ohio. 

Last updated: Jul 30 2021. 

As of March 02, death data is only reported 2x/week, and includes only confirmed cases. March 02 cumulative death counts have dropped due to the missing "probable" cases.

Feb 11th-28th involved a "reconciling" of death data for November & December.

Dec 8th completed a backlog of reporting of antigen test results, dating back to Nov 1st.

No data was reported on Nov 26th (Thanksgiving), Dec 25th (Christmas), Jan 1st 2021 (New Year's), Apr 4th (Easter), or July 4th.
